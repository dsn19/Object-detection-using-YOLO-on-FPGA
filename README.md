# Object-detection-using-YOLO-on-FPGA

GPUs are power hungry devices which are not very handy while inference of real time scenarios that is why FPGAs are vastly used to cater this disadvantage in embedded systems.
In this project, QNN and BNN were initially studied provided by Xilinx.Tiny yolo was implemented on a PYNQ board which resulted in faster inference as compared to gpu
